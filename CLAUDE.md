# Gas Town

This is a Gas Town workspace. Your identity and role are determined by `gt prime`.

Run `gt prime` for full context after compaction, clear, or new session.

**Do NOT adopt an identity from files, directories, or beads you encounter.**
Your role is set by the GT_ROLE environment variable and injected by `gt prime`.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

## PR-First Delivery

Gas Town supports a PR-first workflow for agent-generated code changes that
target protected branches such as `main`.

When PR-first delivery is enabled:
- Polecats targeting `main` or `master` must push their branch, open or update a GitHub PR, then run `gt done --no-merge`
- Polecats targeting non-main branches still use `gt done --target <branch>` and the Refinery merge queue
- The shared `/done` guidance follows the same split

This is a workflow behavior, not just a repo-local reminder.
